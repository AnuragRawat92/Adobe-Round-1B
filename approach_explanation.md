# Approach Explanation – Round 1B: Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to build a Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System that extracts and ranks the most relevant sections from a collection of documents, based on a given persona and their job-to-be-done. This combines intelligent document understanding with personalized context awareness — enabling targeted summarization for specific roles such as a PhD Researcher, Investment Analyst, or Student.

## Methodology


Our solution is implemented as a modular pipeline consisting of the following stages:

### 1. PDF Text Extraction

We use PyMuPDF (fitz) to extract page-level text from PDFs. Each page is stored with metadata such as page number, document name, and raw text. This granularity enables semantic filtering later in the pipeline.

### 2. Persona Conditioning

The system reads a JSON file containing the persona and job description:

```json

{
  "persona": "PhD Researcher in Computational Biology",
  "job": "Prepare a comprehensive literature review..."
}
```
These are concatenated into a single semantic query string used for matching relevant content in the documents.

3. Semantic Ranking (Top-K Retrieval)
Each page and the query are embedded using the SentenceTransformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). Cosine similarity is computed between the query and each page embedding, and the top-K most relevant pages (typically K=5) are selected for deeper analysis.

4. Subsection Refinement
Top-ranked pages often contain a mix of useful and generic content. We apply further filtering and light summarization to extract precise sub-sections that better match the persona’s intent. This stage is designed to be easily extended to include more advanced models.

5. Output Serialization
The final structured results are saved in a JSON format for each collection under the output/ directory. Each output file includes:

Metadata: input documents, persona, job, and timestamp

Ranked sections: document name, page number, section title, and importance rank

Subsection analysis: document name, refined text, and page number(s)

Dataset Handling
We process multiple collections of documents such as:

collection1_gnn: Research papers on Graph Neural Networks

collection2_business: Annual reports for tech companies

collection3_chemistry: Organic chemistry textbook chapters

Each collection contains an input_docs/ folder and a persona_job.json file. Outputs are stored separately per collection.

Constraints Compliance
Our solution is built to meet the challenge constraints:



# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv311

✅ CPU-only execution


✅ Model size under 1GB

✅ Processing time under 60 seconds per collection

Docker Support

The project includes a Dockerfile for containerized execution. This ensures that the pipeline can run consistently across different systems without needing manual environment setup. The container includes all necessary dependencies and runs the main processing script when started.

=======
We include a Dockerfile to containerize the entire pipeline. This ensures the system runs reliably across environments without dependency issues.

To build and run:
 ```
docker build -t adobe-round-1b .
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/input:/app/input" -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" adobe-round-1b
```
 This makes it easy to reproduce results and test submissions without local setup.
